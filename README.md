# JavaExamples-Notes

*Class:*
- A class is a blueprint or prototype from which objects are created.
- A class contains variables (data types) and methods (functions) to describe the behavior of an object.

*Object:*
- Object is a software bundle of related state and behavior.
- Objects have two characteristics namely state and behavior.

*Constructor:*
- Constructor in Java is used in the creation of an Object that is an instance of a Class.
- Constructor name should be same as class name.
- It looks like a method but its not a method. 
- It wont return any value.
- If there is no constructor in a class, then compiler automatically creates a default constructor.

**OOPS Concepts:**
*Inheritance:*
- 'Defination:'Inheritance is a process where one class inherits the properties of another class.
